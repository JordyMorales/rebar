# Development Setup

## Prerequisites

The setup is for OS X only:

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**: minimum version as specified in [`package.json`](package.json#L106).  
* **yarn**: install using `npm install -g yarn`.
* **[cqlah](http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/tools/cqlsh.html)**: optionally installed locally.

## Setting up Scylla in docker

### Setup

```
docker pull scylladb/scylla:3.0.8
docker run --privileged -it --link scylly --rm scylladb/scylla:3.0.8 cqlsh scylly
```

### Start/Stop

```
docker start scylly
docker stop scylly
```

### Troubleshooting

```
cqlsh
docker logs scylly
```

If cqlsh does not manage to connect to docker, or is not installed locally, use:

```
docker run --privileged -it --link elassie --rm strapdata/elassandra cqlsh elassie
```

### Cleanup

```
docker stop scylly
docker rm scylly
```

## Setup on local development machine

In order to set up the project locally, perform the following steps:

| Action                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `git clone https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar.git` | Clone from github. Alternatively, you can download the source and update in some different way. |
| `yarn`                    | Install node packages. |
| `yarn setup-local`        | Set up default configuration for running the boilerplate. |
| Edit `.env`               | Set database server / name, secrets, API keys. etc. |
| `yarn setup-database`     | Creates Cassandra schema. |

In addition to the above, you might want to specify `JWT_SECRET` by modifying the `.env` file. This step can be skipped if you do not care about the actual security and simply want to get the project running.



# Development

## Running in Development Mode

In order to develop, three servers need to be started:

* Web server.
* Webpack server.
* Relay compiler (watching).
* Local tunnel.

This can be done with one command: `yarn dev`.
To open the web app: navigate to `http://localhost:28605`, or whatever IP was assigned when running `yarn update-ip`.

## Configuring Local Tunnel

In some cases it is necessary to make your development environment publicly available under HTTPS. The service [Local Tunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) allows you to easily share a Rebar project on your local development machine without messing with DNS and firewall settings. In order to use LocalTunnel, edit [units/_configuration/rb-base-tools/tunnels.json](https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar/blob/master/units/_configuration/rb-base-tools/tunnels.json). Replace the value of

```
"subdomain": "replace-with-your-own-domain"
```

with your preferred value. Please notice that LocalTunnel allocates subdomain names on a first come first serve basis, for the duration of using the service. Navigate to `https://replace-with-your-own-domain.localtunnel.me`.



# Testing

## Jest

Examples of Jest unit tests are available in [units/rb-base-test](https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar/tree/master/units/rb-base-test).

## End to End Testing

Example of end-to-end tests suing Jest and Puppeteer are available on github in repository [MachineAcuity/rebar-test-e2e](https://github.com/MachineAcuity/rebar-test-e2e).



# Production Setup

In order to run rebar in production-like mode you can:

```
$ yarn build-deployment
...
$ export NODE_ENV=production
$ node ./deployment/units/rb-base-server/server
```

A production  setup would include the `deployment` directory, with appropriate `.env` file, and running `units/rb-base-server/server` in some sort of fashion.
