# Technologies used in Rebar

For the most up to date list of technologies used please go to [CodeFoundries.com](http://codefoundries.com/developer/rebar/technologies-used.html).

## Client side

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Express](https://expressjs.com)                                | Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js |
| [found](https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found)                    | Extensible route-based routing for React applications. |
| [JSS](http://cssinjs.org/)                                      | JSS is a more powerful abstraction over CSS. It uses JavaScript as a language to describe styles in a declarative and maintainable way. |
| [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/)                      | Library for implementing [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) in React. All user interface in this kit is built exclusively with Material UI components. |
| [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)                      | The best library for building modern browser-based and mobile UIs. |
| [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)             | Reusable React component will manage all of your changes to the document head with support for document title, meta, link, script, and base tags. |
| [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/)                      | A Javascript framework for building data-driven react applications. |

## Server side

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)                | The right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages. |
| [Data Loader](https://github.com/facebook/dataloader)           | Generic utility to be used as part of your application's data fetching layer to provide a consistent API over various backends and reduce requests to those backends via batching and caching. |
| [Elassandra](http://www.strapdata.com/)                         | Elassandra Combines Cassandra And Elasticsearch In A Single Powerful Integrated Solution. URB works well with Elassandra. |
| [Express GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql)   | A Node.js express library that allows the creation of GraphQL servers. |
| [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/docs/getting-started/)             | A query language for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client‚Äêserver applications. |
| [JWT](https://jwt.io/)                                          | JSON Web Tokens is an industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)                               | Event-driven, non-blocking I/O runtime based on JavaScript that is lightweight and efficient. |

## Development tools

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [Babel](http://babeljs.io)                                      | Transpiles ESX to ESX and performs relay transformations. |
| [ESLint](https://eslint.org)                                    | A fully pluggable tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. |
| [Flow](http://flowtype.org/)                                    | Static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs. |
| [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)                      | Git hooks for eslint and prettier. |
| [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/)               | Code formatter for javaScript. |
| [React Hot Loader](gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)         | Allows tweaking of React components in real time. |
| [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)                             | Bundles npm packages, application Java Script, CSS, images, etc. into bundles. |



# Development Setup

For the most up to date setup instructions please go to the [development setup instructions](http://codefoundries.com/developer/rebar/development-setup.html).

## Initial Development Machine Setup

The setup is for OS X only. Prerequisites:

<<<<<<< HEAD
* **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** minimum version as specified in `package.json`.  
* **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** minimum version as specified in `package.json`.  
=======
* **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** minimum version: `10.6.0`.  
* **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** minimum version: `6.1.0`.  
>>>>>>> revision-4.0.2
* **Install yarn** run `npm install -g yarn`

## Initial Project setup on local machine

In order to set up the project locally, perform the following steps:

| Action                    | Notes                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `git clone https://github.com/codefoundries/UniversalRelayBoilerplate` | Clone from github. Alternatively, you can download the source and update in some different way. |
| `yarn` | Install node packages. |
| `yarn setup-local` | Set up default configuration for running the boilerplate. |
| Edit `.env` | Set database server / name, secrets, API keys. etc. |
| `yarn setup-database` | Creates Cassandra schema. |

In addition to the above, you might want to specify `JWT_SECRET` by modifying the `.env` file. This step can be skipped if you do not care about the actual security and simply want to get the project running.

## Running in development mode

In order to develop, three servers need to be started:

* Web server.
* Webpack server.
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
* Relay compiler (watching).
>>>>>>> revision-4.0.2

This can be done with one command:

* Start application HTTP and Webpack server: `yarn dev`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
To open the app:

* Navigate to `http://localhost:26005`, or whatever IP was assigned when running `yarn update-ip` or after installation.

(currently not available) To run the iOS app in the emulator:

* If the IP of your development machine has changed, run `yarn update-ip`.

## Configuring Cassandra locally

* Install and configure Cassandra following the steps in [Cassandra Installation on Mac](/developer/cassandra/cassandra-installation-mac.html).
* Update the name of the database and the database server in `/.env`, or use the defaults. The defaults are:

```javascript
CASSANDRA_CONNECTION_POINTS=localhost
CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE=urb
```

* Create the database with `yarn setup-database`.
